Hello,
Here you can find the three projects I coded watching the Udemy course 'React Front to Back 2022' from Brad Traversy
All three projects were reproduced while follwing the course.

The first project (Feedback App) shows the fundamentals such as components, hooks, props, state, etc.
The second project (Github Finder) shows how to work with 3rd party APIs.
The third project (House Marketplace) shows how to use Firebase 9, authentication, Firestore queries, file storage and more.
